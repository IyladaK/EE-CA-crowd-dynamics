# EE CS MS crowd dynamics files for IBDP EE Computer Science
uses matplotlib and slightly apadted cromosim library

uses code adapted from sylvian-faure example files for cromosim cellular automata and cromosim micro social

cellular_automata.py uses the json file input.json
micro_test.py uses teh json file input_room.json

both codes produce an approximately 20m by 2m hallway, with a 0.8m doorway at the bottom

used for research paper on the limitations of cellular automata crowd dynamics models
